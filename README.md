# Flowooh

Flowooh is a light-weight extensible workflow based on Nodejs which is built with Typescript.

Flowooh does not rely on any service framework and can easily be integrated into different Node server applications such as Express, Koa, NestJs, etc. This makes Flowooh very flexible and easy to use. Flowooh provides rich features and APIs to help developers quickly build workflow engines and workflow applications. Additionally, Flowooh supports plugins and extensions, allowing developers to customize and extend functionality based on their needs.

# Vision and purpose

Workflow engines are commonly used in development, and there are already excellent workflow projects such as Activiti, Flowable, Camunda, etc.

However, there is a lack of similar tools or projects on Node.js. I hope to build a workflow engine based on Node.js to help developers better integrate and implement workflow applications on the Node.js server.
